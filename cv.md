## About Me
Good time of day.
My name is Nadezhda and now I am learning the profession of a frontend developer in JavaScript, I know how to make websites in HTML using CSS and, at an elementary level, I know JavaScript, as well as I know about popular JavaScript frameworks, then the basics of web development, I can work with git as well from the console. Several educational websites have been written.

I have no bad habits, I play sports, participated and won mathematical Olympiads, I have leadership qualities and developed soft skills that I developed at work as a personal trainer. Proactive, stress-resistant, purposeful, persevering, and easily trainable. I'm learning English.

Why I became an interface developer is because I like to create something and do something useful, as well as work on interesting tasks. I want to realize myself in what I really like and what inspires me to further develop in this direction.
